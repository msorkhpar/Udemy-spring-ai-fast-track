# Project structure

Each course section would have a folder based on its index. Inside each directory there will be one or more
subdirectories which are Maven modules. In addition, each section directory contains a *.rest file containing the http
rest request needed by it sections.

There is a branch in this project called remote-main which has been provided by the tutor of this course covering all
sections with Java. You can peak the implementation in that branch without missing or removing of any files in the main
branch. Therefore, you should be extra careful when looking for the other branch so that there will be no impact on the
original main branch or any intruption for the developers of this repo.
